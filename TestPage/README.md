# Single Test Page

This project contains three main pages: **Login Page**, **Counter Page**, and **Posts Page** â€” all designed for testing different functionalities in a single-page application.

## Login Page  
This page tests the login functionality. It requires you to enter the correct password twice consecutively; if you fail to do so, you will not be able to log in.

## Counter Page  
A simple React-like counter to demonstrate and test DOM manipulation.

## Posts Page  
Uses a JSON database to render posts as individual components on a single page. Each post can be edited or deleted dynamically.
